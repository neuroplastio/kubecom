// Package keybind is kubecom's key bindings engine: which action a key sequence
// runs in the context that holds the keyboard (D303). It is plexos's keymap (its
// D119), ported rather than imported — plexos is private, kubecom is public — with
// kubecom's own path (context.go).
//
// A keymap is built from layers of documents — kubecom's defaults (default.kdl,
// in internal/tui/keymap) and the user's `keymap` (config.kdl's, then the
// overlay's) — each a list of `bind`s, `unbind`s, `group` labels, `context`
// blocks and a `leader`, read from KDL (Parse). A context is a CEL expression over
// the Path, compiled once at load, so a keymap that loads never fails on a key.
//
// The package knows keys, contexts and action names as strings; it does not know
// which actions exist. The registry that does checks a document (Doc.Check), so
// this package stays free of the TUI and a non-terminal front end can feed it.
//
// # What wins
//
// For bindings of the same keys whose contexts hold:
//
//  1. the deepest context wins (how far into the Path the expression reaches);
//  2. at equal depth the layer wins: user over default;
//  3. within a layer, the later line wins.
//
// An exact binding that is also a prefix of a longer one waits only for longer
// bindings at least as deep as itself, and runs when the sequence times out
// (Match reports both). And a text field keeps its text (D303 pt 5): with `field`
// on the path, a sequence that starts with a key that types text goes to the field
// unless a binding at least as deep as the field takes it.
